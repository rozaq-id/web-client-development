## Program Output

```
1. Find the area of a rectangle
Length: 5, Width: 3 → Area = 15

2. Find the diameter, circumference, and area of a circle
Radius: 5 → Diameter: 10, Circumference: 31.4159, Area: 78.5398

3. Find the third angle of a triangle
Given angles: a = 80°, b = 65° → The third angle is: 35°

4. Find the difference between two dates
Days difference between Sun Mar 19 2023 and Tue Mar 21 2023 → 2 days
